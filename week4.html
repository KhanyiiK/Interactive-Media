            <p><b>My experience continuing the development of my website</b><br>
                The development of my website has been good so far. I've come to understand how crucial <br>
                wireframes are. Otherwise, I would have to assemble my website haphazardly, and that would <br>
                just cause confusion and clouding my head with too many ideas and possibilities. I've also <br>
                been considering various approaches to developing my wireframes. I began by sketching it out <br>
                on paper and then put my annotated notes all over. Now Iâ€™m trying to digitalize my wireframes <br>
                and make them look for sexy. I need to revise my website's objective in light of this week's <br>
                lectures and readings in order to better serve the user. Initially, I based my design on <br>
                aesthetics I liked and had come across while researching. My knowledge of fresh opportunities for<br>
                the website was greatly expanded by the JavaScript lessons.

                <p>
                    <b>How do my wireframes hold up against the reading and lectures on UI?</b><br>
                    This week, we looked more closely at the user interface (UI), specifically how it serves as the <br>
                    system's means of communication when an interaction occurs. Each UI element consists of a Signifier<br>
                    (what the user sees) and a Signified (what the element does).  Without giving it any time or consideration,<br>
                    I had based the most of my design on another website. After the lecture, my view on what I wanted for my <br>
                    website largely shifted. My wireframe has to be modified in accordance with the UI and the experiences I want my users to have.

                    <b>How does the UI relate to how we define interactivity?</b><br>
                    This week, we looked more closely at the user interface, specifically how it serves as the system's <br>
                    communication channel when interaction occurs. When it comes to defining UI and interaction, they are as <br>
                    follows: A graphical representation of a software or system that allows people to interact with it is referred<br>
                    to as a user interface (UI). Interactivity refers to how and to what extent the user may engage with the UI and<br>
                    the system it represents. Interactivity is related to UI since the interface expresses, allows, and embodies<br>
                    interaction. As users engage with the system to get a source of response (output), the UI not only shows how<br>
                     users may interact with the system, but it also communicates/provides feedback on the sought result.
