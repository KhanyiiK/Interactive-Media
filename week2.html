            <p><b>My Experience starting with HTML</b><br>
                Learning HTML has been both thrilling and difficult for me. I've learned a lot about creating and formatting websites,<br>
                including how to use HTML elements. Understanding the redifficult aspects of learning HTML. To gain a better grasp of how tags operate,<br>
                I had to invest a significant amount of time reading tutorials and experimenting with various tags. Understanding the fundamentals of<br>
                HTML has proven to be important for building a website that is both aesthetically pleasing and useful. I was able to discover internet <br>
                tools that can assist me in learning HTML and give me a better understanding of the different components used to build a website. Ultimately,<br>
                my HTML learning experience has been extremely gratifying. It has enabled me to consider how to build websites that are both aesthetically appealing and useful. I'm excited to continue learning and honing my Coding abilities.

                    <b>Reflection on the readings. </b><br>
                    The readings this week were a lot to take in and digest but they were overall very insightful. After reading both assigned readings, <br>
                    I concluded that websites must be useful, approachable, and visually appealing. Websites are not only used to display information but <br>
                    are also used to inspire and motivate those visiting the website. Performance is also very essential, but it is closely related to the <br>
                    usefulness of the website. The website can only operate well if it works well and with a specific intention. The main point from Lawson,<br>
                    Bruce’s “Why You Should Choose HTML5” and  Lawson, Bruce. “How A Screen Reader User Accesses The Web: A Smashing Video.”<br>
                    •	Don't overuse h1> tags. Make h1 the primary heading on your website, then use h2 through h4 in the correct order without missing any steps.<br>
                    •	When combined with aria label, section> can be used to indicate to screen reader users the start and conclusion of a specific section of a document.<br>
                    •	For screen reader users, the tags "main," "header," "footer," and "nav" are very helpful. For people who don't use assistive technology, they are completely obvious. Use them, then.<br>
                    •	Article can refer to any self-contained object; it's not just for blog posts. It also aids WatchOS in correctly displaying your information.

                    <b>Reflection on internet histories.</b><br>
                    The way we interact, conduct business, and obtain information has changed as a result of the internet. Its influence cannot be exaggerated; <br>
                    it has changed the way we live. The internet has made it possible for us to interact with one another in ways that were previously unthinkable <br>
                    thanks to its constantly developing technology. It has a past of invention, taking chances, and inventiveness, with businesses like Apple, <br>
                    Google, and Amazon taking the lead in creating new forms of commerce and communication.Cybercrime and security lapses are becoming <br>
                    more prevalent on the internet, and this has not been without its share of dark times. The internet is a strong instrument that can be used <br>
                    for good or bad, so it's crucial to consider the possible effects of our online behavior.Because social media is used to both promote variety<br>
                    and propagate hatred, the internet is a reflection of our society and culture. As we reflect on the evolution of the internet, we must work <br>
                    to ensure that we handle all of our online dealings with care and regard for the rights of others. We all have a part in this duty, which<br>
                    will only grow in importance as the internet develops.

                <p><b>Website discoveries and interests.</b><br>
                    Upon the assignment coming up where we must submit a deployed site with styling exhibiting : appropriate design, typography and<br>
                    good UI/UX practices. I have been looking at some web developers personal portfolios and how they have laid them out so that <br>
                    viewers know about them and their work. All the websites that I personally really engaged with had this type of minimalist style<br>
                    with pretty fonts and simple images, they were all spaced out with a lot of blank space and room to read and view all the projects<br>
                    the developer has done. All the websites were very aesthetically pleasing in their own ways and reflected the personality of the <br>
                    developers. Here are the links of the websites I liked : <br>
