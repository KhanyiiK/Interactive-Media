            <p><b>Your experience setting up Git.</b><br>
                The setup of Github was easy and seamless but a bit confusing if you didn’t know where to <br>
                look. As someone who has never used Github, I didn’t know where to look so signup <br>
                 because it was so small and tucked away in the corner of the screen. But once you are set <br>
                  up and an interesting display of the galaxy takes over your screen it just plays around with <br>
                   the application and tries to figure it out.

                    <b>Reflection on the readings. </b><br>
                    The 3 readings I read were informative but I found the terminology confusing and got lost at some <br>
                    stages, to the point where I would read a sentence over again to try and understand. After doing <br>
                    some research on the internet about the readings and their perspective authors then only did I start <br>
                    to understand more. I think I could look more into the readings in the future and possibly ask others for <br>
                     their feedback and how they understood the readings.

                    <b>Your goals for this course.</b><br>
                    My goals for this course are as follows:<br>
                    •	Get 70% overall <br>
                    •	Complete all exercises on time <br>
                    •	Submit all assignments and essays on time <br>
                    •	Take in as much content as possible <br>
                    •	Learn the necessary skills and practices to make a good website 
                </p>
                <p><b>What I did on the internet</b><br>
                    This week I mostly was on my social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and shopping websites.<br>
                    I wouldn’t say any of these platforms were productive or offered me any inspiration for a future website but all of <br>
                    them functioned in different ways. All have in common the function of scrolling aimlessly over pictures or videos until<br>
                     you settle on one for a few minutes.
