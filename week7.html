            <p><b>My experience continuing the development of my website:.</b><br>
                In all honesty, despite the frustrations I've experienced when my <br>
                design or code refused to cooperate with me, I discovered that I genuinely<br>
                liked developing my website. I genuinely built a website from scratch, which <br>
                is truly mind-boggling because I never imagined I'd be able to do so.  I had to <br>
                update certain components of my website, but the adjustments were minor because they <br>
                only comprised modest navigation choices that I wanted to add. I needed to do this <br>
                since I needed to consider UX and UI. Some layouts seemed better in theory but not in practice.
                </p>

                    <b>IxD Process: </b><br>
                    All the information required for this question can be found in the Design Section<br>
                    I considered the flow of my website. As a way of simple navigation for the user, <br>
                    I aim to have a header that is continuously visible (at least in desktop mode). <br>
                    I'm aiming to make each of my pages internally familiar, since this will help the <br>
                    user rapidly become acclimated to the structure of my website, and I'll employ <br>
                    exterior familiarity features to provide the user with a smooth experience when <br>
                    browsing my website for the first time.

                    <b>Reflection on this weeks readings?</b><br>
                    After reading Hassenzahl and Tractinsky's 2006 work "User Experience - A Research Agenda,"<br>
                    user experience design is the major issue. The reading gave an informative review of user <br>
                    experience in regard to traditional usability problems in order to investigate the emotional <br>
                    and social components of user engagement with products and services. The author's definition of<br>
                    UX as a "momentary, primarily feeling" of engaging with a product or service helped me understand <br>
                    that UX is about more than simply functionality, but also the user's emotional response to the encounter.
