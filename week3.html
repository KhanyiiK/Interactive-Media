            <p><b>My experience continuing the development of my website </b><br>
                I've been able to deepen my knowledge and comprehension of web development by continuing my expertise <br>
                in website development and studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am now acquainted with the different<br>
                tools and methods that can be used in web development. Understanding the significance of using the<br>
                appropriate tools and methods for the job at hand has helped me decide when to apply them. Making <br>
                this website completely responsive and offering a fantastic user experience to the user is one of my<br>
                major priorities. Additionally, I want it to be visually appealing so that it can reflect my character<br>
                and who I am. Overall, I've been able to comprehend web programming better and learn how to build a <br>
                website from start. Using the tools and methods at my disposal, I was able to design a user-friendly, <br>
                engaging, and aesthetically pleasing website.

                    <b>Reflection on the reading and understanding of UI/UX </b><br>
                    A work on the subject of context's importance in literary interpretation is Standard and Context,<br>
                    by Mailloux, published in 1983. It investigates how reading a work in a particular setting can have <br>
                    an impact on conventions, or the typical methods of understanding a text. According to Mailloux,<br>
                    context is essential to understanding a document. Conventions are not fixed; rather, they can be <br>
                    interpreted in different ways depending on the reader's situation. Additionally, he talks about the <br>
                    connections between social and literary norms, emphasizing the value of knowing a text's social setting <br>
                    in order to fully comprehend its meaning. As learning Web developers we can learn a range of principles <br>
                    about designing user interfaces that work from Mailloux (1983). Mailloux concentrates on the use of <br>
                    conventions in user interfaces to establish a feeling of context that can aid users in comprehending the<br>
                    goal and functionality of a website or application. He places emphasis on how conventions can be used<br>
                    to improve the usability of a website or application and can help users make choices and direct their behavior.

                    <b>Thoughts of course material </b><br>
                    Usually, I think it's helpful to look at the same piece from different angles. It sometimes makes sense to <br>
                    read the related supplementary material, in my opinion, if there are ideas in the technical lessons that I do <br>
                    not comprehend. I feel like I'm revising my work for the week by watching the previous classes. Since the material <br>
                    is being given from a variety of perspectives, I am also learning more about it. It's advantageous, in my opinion, <br>
                    that we have access to classes that present various viewpoints on the subject. My comprehension of the task is greatly<br>
                    enhanced by watching them. Your vantage point is widened, and you are given the opportunity to consider ideas or issues<br>
                    from various angles.
