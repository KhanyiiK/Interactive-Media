            <p><b>My IxD documentation</b><br>
                <b>Goal Alignments:</b><br>
                 My aim is to make it easy for the user (the marker) to browse around my portfolio website, <br>
                 which will have a homepage, a blog part, a design section, an essay section, a profile screen,<br>
                and a portfolio area. Also my goal is to make my website look aesthetically pleasing and display <br>
                my personality and interests.  
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Information Structure (Content Mapping): </b><br>
                Each page has two navigation bar at the top of the screen. The homepage (the first page of the website)<br>
                provides a quick overview of the website and its navigation.All my pages have a similar format with the <br>
                nav-bar at the top, the name of that section as well as a short description of that section. The only <br>
                difference will be at the bottom of the pages when you scroll down that will display the content of that <br>
                page in different ways. The Blog page includes a blog selection window as well as the actual blogs.<br>
                The Design page will include a style guide, wireframes, and an explanation of my IxD approach (much like this section of the blog). There will be nothing in the essay area at this time. Similar to the blog page, the Portfolio page will have placeholders for my future portfolio pages to be added. 
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>User Flow (Screens, Behavior, and Decisions): </b><br>
                The user will begin at the homepage. They will select one of the four sections at the top of the page to go to.<br>
                If the user navigates to the Blog or Portfolio pages, they may utilize the corresponding selection panel to skip <br>
                to the chosen blog article or portfolio item. Once the user has selected a blog post or project they can click on<br>
               ‘Read More’ or ‘View Project’ that will take them a new page to either read or view that item. When a visitor visits <br>
               the Design or Essay sections they can scroll down to see the essay or utilize the image sliders to see the wireframes <br>
               and style guides. Because sections like the Essay and Portfolio only have placeholders there is no futher interaction<br>
                with it other than to just view the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Interface Elements:  </b><br>
                The user may interact with my website in two ways: by scrolling through each page or by clicking on links that will move the <br>
                user elsewhere on that page or to another page.
                </p>

                <b>Design (Style Guide, Wireframes): </b><br>
                In the design area of my website.
